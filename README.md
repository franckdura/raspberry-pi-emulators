# raspberry-pi-emulators
This repository includes solutions to easily deploy Raspberry PÃ¯ emulators on any Debian-based operating system supporting Docker.

[**QEMU**]("https://github.com/qemu/qemu"), licensed under the [GNU General Public License, version 2]("https://github.com/qemu/qemu/blob/master/COPYING"), is the emulator software supporting all the presented boards, which are initially ARM-based. 

This project uses [Docker]("https://github.com/docker/docker-ce-packaging"), which is licensed under the [Apache 2.0 License]("https://github.com/docker/docker-ce-packaging/blob/master/LICENSE").

## <a id="setup"></a>**Set Up**

<br>

- If **Docker** has never been installed on your system

Please run


```Bash
bash docker-install.sh
```

Also, the `dos2unix` package is required.

```Bash
apt-get install dos2unix
```



<br>

## <a id="rpi2b"></a>**Raspberry PI 2b**
<br>
This script runs the official Qemu 2.9.0 implementation of the Raspberry Pi 2b board, named `raspi2`, in a Docker container.
<br><br>

> It implements :
> - CPU Broadcom 2709 quad core cortex-a7 (ARM 32 bits)
> - 1 GB RAM
> - Raspbian OS (Jessie 2016-05-27 release)
> - Raspberry Pi 2 board
> - No networking

<br>


First, use the command below to correctly format the script

```bash
dos2unix rpi2b/qemu-official-raspi2b-docker.sh
```
If it is the first time, to **build and install dependencies**, please run
```bash
bash rpi2b/qemu-official-raspi2b-docker.sh -b
# default login : pi
# default password : raspberry
```
**Otherwise**, please just run
```bash
bash rpi2b/qemu-official-raspi2b-docker.sh
``` 

## <a id="rpi3b"></a>**Raspberry PI 3b+**
<br>
This script runs the official Qemu 6.2.0 implementation of the Raspberry Pi 3b+ board, named `raspi3b`, in a Docker container.

<br>

> It implements :
> - CPU Broadcom 2710 quad core cortex-a53 (ARMv8 64 bits)
> - 1 GB RAM
> - Raspios-arm64 (Bullseye 2022-01-28 release)
> - Raspberry Pi 3b+ board
> - Networking & port forwarding from 2222 (host) to 22 (guest)


<br>

First, use the command below to correctly format the script 
```bash
dos2unix rpi3b+/qemu-official-raspi3b-docker.sh
```
If it is the first time, to **build and install dependencies**, please run
```bash
bash rpi3b+/qemu-official-raspi3b-docker.sh -b
# default login : pi
# default password : raspberry
```
**Otherwise** 
```bash
bash rpi3b+/qemu-official-raspi3b-docker.sh
``` 

<br>

## <a id="rpi4b"></a>**Raspberry PI 4b**
<br>
This script runs a virtio machine (`virt`), implementing the same hardware as a Raspberry Pi 4b with a `raspios-rpi4-arm64` OS.

<br>

> It implements :
> - Virtual CPU quad core cortex-a72 (ARMv8 64 bits)
> - 4 GB RAM
> - Raspios-arm64 (Bullseye-rpi4 2022-01-21 release)
> - Networking & port forwarding from 2222 (host) to 22 (guest)

First, use the command below to correctly format the script 
```bash
dos2unix rpi4b/qemu-virtio-raspi4b-docker.sh
```
If it is the first time, to **build and install dependencies**, please run
```bash
bash qemu-virtio-raspi4b-docker.sh -b
# default login : root
# default password : 
```
**Otherwise** 
```bash
bash rpi4b/qemu-virtio-raspi4b-docker.sh
``` 
<br>

## <a id="terminate"></a>**Terminate**

When you want to **stop** your containers, run
```bash
dos2unix stop-containers.sh && bash stop-containers.sh
```

When you want to **remove** your containers and the associated files, please run
```bash
dos2unix remove-containers.sh && bash remove-containers.sh -r "YOURDEVICE"
# with YOURDEVICE being either raspi2b, raspi3b or raspi4bvirtio
```
